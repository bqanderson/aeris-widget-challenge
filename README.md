#Aeris Weather Widget App Challenge

* Using data from the Aeris API, create a "Current Conditions" weather widget.

* The exact design, layout, and behavior of the widget is up to you. The only requirement is the that a user should be able to update their location using an HTML input.

* The widget should be embeddable in a web page, like so:

  `<script type="text/javascript>`
  `var widgetContainer = document.getElementById('current-conditions');` `CurrentConditionsWidget(widgetContainer);`
  `</script>`

* To test the widget, you may create a free dev account [here][account-page].

* Documentation for the Aeris API “observations” endpoint is [here][doc-page].

* Please feel free to contact us with any questions regarding the requirements, API usage, or anything else you run into.

* We expect this to take no longer than 1-3 hours. If it seems like a bigger task than that, or if you run into any major blockers, please get in touch.
